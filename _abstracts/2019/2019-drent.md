Music is an important part of our everyday lives and can be found in all cultures and societies across the world. Even though the concept of music is universal, the function of music is different in every context. The medium of music is an easy way to convey your message, which is why music is so widespread and popular. If music plays such an important role in our societies and in our lives, what are then the social, cultural and evolutionary functions of music?

First of all, in the Bedouin communities lyric poetry, called Ghinnawas are used as a vehicle for personal expression and confidential communication (Abu-Lughod 2016: 171-222). Ghinnawas therefore serve multiple functions as it can convey multiple sentiments. As well as being a personal statement, Ghinnawas are mostly used by women to express their discontent. Women in Bedouin communities are not supposed to express their sentiments in the daily structure, but are allowed to do so hidden in these lyric poems to other women (ibid).
Another function of music is that it has the ability to transform a person into someone they are not. For instance, when Serbs are listening to Gypsy music, they can experience the free gypsy inside themselves while singing and dancing along with the Gypsy music. Making Serbs feel free and limitless. However, in their daily lives, Serbs will never want to be associated with gypsy culture in any way. In Serbian culture, gypsies are perceived as being dirty, loud and lazy, and everything that Serbs are not (Port 1997: 23-24). This is a good example of Self and Othering, even though the medium of music makes this line between the Self and the Other very thin.

Another cultural and social function of music is that of emancipation. The flamenco is a typical Spanish music genre and type of dance with a very strong rhythm. This form of music and dance has however become a very large part of Japanese culture. The reason why it has gained such popularity in Japan, especially among Japanese women, is because of the very powerful stomping and clapping that is associated with this type of dance and music. Women in Japan are bound to be silent in their daily lives, not only verbally, but while walking and performing tasks as well. Dancing Flamenco gives them the power to finally make a sound, both literally as figuratively (Ede 2017).

This establishes that there are many important social and cultural functions of music. However, does music have an evolutionary function? In other words, is music an evolutionary adaptation? If so, what advantage is given to individuals who perform music? Most researchers, like Pinker, agree that music does not provides us with a direct increase in survival chances (Huron 2001: 44). If this is the case, why does music has or remains an important part in human lives?

Huron gives us 8 possible theories that could explain why we have evolved the ability to appreciate and make music. He does argue that none of these theories are conclusive or actually have been proven. One of the theories has to do with mate selection, making music a medium through which to choose a fit partner (Huron 2001: 47). Other theories depict that music has evolved as a way to help our overall development, as well as in language as in our detailed perception (ibid). Most of his other theories have to do with social cohesion, group effort and conflict reduction, meaning that music has evolved as a way to improve our cooperative skills and to enhance social bonding in groups (ibid).

To build further on the social cohesion theory and the group effort theory of Huron, the article of Kirschner and Tomasello shows in their results after performing two experiments that music promotes prosocial behavior in 4-year old children. These results could explain that music behaviors indeed have an evolutionary function (Kirschner and Tomasello 2010). Tarr, Launay and Dunbar also give arguments in favor of these social bonding theories. They argue that by actively participating in music and thereby synchronizing with other individuals and their beat, endorphins are released, therefore elevating the individual’s pain threshold and increasing positive affect (Tarr, Launay and Dunbar 2014).

In conclusion, music currently serves various important functions in our daily lives. After researching the evolutionary function of music, I became less and less sure about the ancient functions of music. Much research points to social bonding theories as the evolutionary function of music, however, I argue that the evolutionary function of music is not one-fold, but consists of multiple components as described by Huron. What I do know is that without music our lives would be very blend, so I am glad that we evolved the ability to make music.
