A language L is compositional, if and only if, the meaning of each complex expression e of L, is determined by the meaning of its constituents as well as the way they are put together by the rules of L [1]. This property allows the combination of smaller meaningful units to more complex structures and is therefore crucial to enable the productivity as well as flexibility, which distinguishes human language from other animal communication systems.

Recently, the idea that this property is uniquely human has been questioned by researchers suggesting to have found compositionality in non-human animal communication systems. Findings show that japanese tits produce combinations of calls in particular contexts, which evoke specific responses in receivers [2]. The authors suggest, that the birds combine their basic ’ABC’ call indicating predators, eliciting a scanning behaviour in receivers, and their ’D’ call used in order to attract flock members, provoking an approach behavior in receivers. Their resulting ’ABC-D’ call is then used to recruit flock members in order to mob a stationary predator, eliciting simultaneous scanning and approaching behavior in receivers. A relevant finding in primate communication are the combination of two basic call types (hacks, pyows) in male putty-nosed monkeys [3]. Arnold and colleagues found out, that while a sequence of hacks indicates eagle

presence and a sequence of pyows represents a general alarm, pyow-hack per- mutations, either on their own or in combination with a pyow or hack sequence, predict forthcoming group travel. Lastly, the probably most intriguing finding in this research area, is the use of suffixation in the campbell’s monkey alarm calls [4]. Males give krak calls to leopards and hok calls to eagles, but merging each call with the suffix -oo seems to generalize their calls. Thus, a krak-oo call is not directed towards a leopard anymore but rather towards a wider range or disturbances, while a hok-oo call represents a general non-ground alters. These findings of combinatorial features in non-human animal communication could be interpreted as one of the first evidence for compositional expressions beyond human language.


Not only should research into compositionality in animal communication systems focus auditory but also visual communication. Humans are compositional communicators, which make use of compositionality not only in spoken language but also in sign language and even when expressing emotions. A very recently published paper by Ona et al. investigate compositionality in chimpanzee non-verbal communication [5]. They examine different combinations of gestures and facial expressions in both negative and positive contexts, and deduce their different combinatorial meanings from the reactions of receivers. Indeed, they did find an augmentative effect, however only in positive contexts.

However promising these findings may appear to be, critics point out, what
they refer to as, a crucial distinction between two forms of compositionality:
limited (trivial) and genuine (non-trivial) compositionality [6]. A key aspect
of human language is that the meaning of a word sequence cannot always be
inferred by simply combining the meanings of its constituents. Thus, sentences
that need grammatical operations in order to transmit their intended meaning,
qualify as genuine compositionality. Contrary, a sequence such as ’warm jacket’
qualifies as limited compositionality, as its meaning can simply be inferred by
its parts. As long as studies on non-human animal communication systems do
not elaborate on this issue, we can only assume limited compositionality.

As there is no convincing evidence suggesting that genuine compositionality
is also found in communication systems other than human language, this ability
can be classified as uniquely human until further research suggests otherwise.
Now, the question arises what evolutionary pressures led to the emergence of
such a significant trait for our communication system. The findings of [5] sug-
gest that augmentative effects in chimpanzee non-verbal communication only
occur in positive interactions. A plausible evolutionary explanation for this
phenomenon, might be that individuals in negative contexts may prefer fast
and distinct signals which can more easily be interpreted by conspecifics. This
could in turn also be the key in order to explain why no other animal com-
munication system has evolved genuine compositionality. It may be the case
that compositionality could only have evolved in a mostly positive environment
as such an environment would not necessarily prefer distinct and easily inter-
pretable sequences of signals. In humans this predominance of positive context
may have been achieved through cultural evolution, promoting larger groups
and allowing elaborate tool use which together enabled an environment safe
enough to promote the evolution of compositionality
