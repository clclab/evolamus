Discussing the evolution of music in modern circumstances requires some foundational knowledge on the transmission of music, namely, how the horizontal and vertical domains act. The former, recognized as the passage of qualities from an unrelated culture or group of people to another, is best embodied by the sharing of diverse styles by two populations. Its counterpart, the vertical transfer of features from one generation to the next, can be identified as the distribution of musical aspects from parent to child. 

The impact of these areas has been subject to continued debate, as some findings indicate that horizontal collaboration is an essential component of music creation, at least in sampling techniques (Youngblood, 2019). Yet, there is an undeniable generational contribution to the development of fundamental musical concepts, such as metrics, rhythm, and melody (Sylvie Le Bomin, 2016). Regarding popular music, papers have observed that a universal and quantifiable shift in pitch, timbre, and loudness of songs is transpiring (Joan Serra et al., 2012), and alterations in contemporary music coincide with social changes, as was most highlighted by the rap boom (Youngblood, 2019). 

The initial hypothesis that homogenization of music is not presently occurring due to stable vertical transmission garnered support from Japan, a country of interest given that it underwent two extended periods of isolationism. The land to the far east became a hotbed for western influence after facing years of geographically staggered creativity induced by WWII (Music Educators Journal, 1950). Excitement for this overseas sound wained as artists grew incapable of making their audience identify with them (Herd, 1984), which culminated in a multifaceted bust that allowed local acts to gain relevance over international ones (Guy de Launey, 1995). Japanese history clearly shows how members of a community can maintain their artistic autonomy, but one may not easily extend this display of self-determination to the global stage. 

While it is true of Japan that vertical power outweighed the horizontal, no studies have taken a look at the international community in this way. Thus, the production of a pilot study, with the goal of taking into account more nations, began. The investigation took the top 20 songs spanning the current year from 25 countries, including at least 2 countries in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Oceania. This endeavor used data taken from the website Top40-charts.com, a page that applies algorithms that check airplay, sales, and streams for a track in order to formulate their charts. After averaging out the resulting data using excel, a pattern of immigrant-heavy countries leading the number of shared tunes started emerging. A correlation between these two factors was ascertained, supporting the argument that modern-day music could become less diverse as globalization continues. This conclusion negates the earlier hypothesis, confirming that horizontal transmission is, at least now, more influential as humans expand beyond their natural homes. 

The verdict could prove relevant to the evolutionary theory that music is a tool for social cohesion since migrants may bring their auditorial stylings to new lands. Further research can verify that the integration of these forms is ongoing, signaling that the union of people is a significant aspect of music. Therefore, I propose that the study continue, looking at more than just the year of 2019, while also establishing an emphasis on genres and their rise. Tests should likewise check the relationship between emigration and origins of popular songs to additionally cement the findings here.
