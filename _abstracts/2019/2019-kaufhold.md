<p>Almost every culture on earth have a long tradition of dance and music making in groups<sup>2</sup>. It can therefore be assumed that music-making and dancing have played a central role in the history of evolution. The size of groups and the willingness to cooperate is often described as uniquely human. But how did these connections arise?</p>

<p>I therefore hypothesize that music making, and dancing evolved to promote community bonding by increasing cooperation und reducing tension. I will argue that there are two factors underlying this process (<em>see figure 1</em>).  First synchronicity and second endorphin release through <em>Endogenous Opioid System</em> (EOS) which is described by BOTSA (<em>The Brain Opioid Theory of Social Attachment</em>).</p>


<p>In humans the endogenous opioid release, especially endorphins are associated with an increase feeling of interpersonal warmth, euphoria, well-being and bliss<a name="_ednref1">[1]</a>. Endorphins are involved in social bonding across primate species (especially during grooming) and are related to social bonding in many non-human animals<a name="_ednref2">[2]</a>. Given the role of endorphins in bonding in other species it is logical that the EOS may also underpin human social bonds.  Additionally, a lot of studies provide empirical evidences for the role of EOS in music-related activities<sup>2<a name="_ednref3">[3]</a>45</sup>. However, because there is no ethically justifiable method to measure this correlation directly<a name="_ednref4">[4]</a>, caution should be exercised in respect of all these findings due to the use of pain tolerance (pain threshold) as a proxy for endogenous opioid release.</p>

<p>People tend to spontaneously and unintentionally synchronize movements with other´s even when instructed not to do so<sup>2</sup>. Synchronizing full-body dance movements increased strangers ‘self-reported feelings of social closeness to one another and synchronization between people can influence their subsequent positive social feeling towards one another. Arguments are based on the idea that moving in synchrony leads to cooperative behavior and feeling of social closeness because of a coactivation of action and perception networks which is believed to blur a sense of “others” and “self”.<a name="_ednref5">[5]</a> The feeling of social closeness can be measured by self-reported questions and behavioral measure<sup>5</sup>.</p>

<p>It should be noted, however, that neither of the two factors are exclusively due to the effect of music-making and dancing. So other synchronous activities like rowing<sup>2</sup> lead to the same effect and endorphins are also released by other activities like eating chocolate.<a name="_ednref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>But since studies often show both factors (synchronicity and the role of EOS) and provide clues for both<sup>5</sup> it is likely that some combination of endorphin release and synchronicity leads to the social bonding effect of music, although the relationship between the two mechanisms remains to be sufficiently explored. </p>
<p>Although grooming is a suitable method to create social closeness, it is very expansive in terms of time and cannot include many individuals. Human might have developed additional behaviors that allow bonding between multiple individuals simultaneously. The factors shown above demonstrate how a feeling of euphoria can be triggered and how fear of strangers can be reduced. These effects may play a particular role in bonding large social groups in humans. Music and dancing promote highly synchronized behavior which could be an explanation for human’s characteristics hyper cooperativeness.</p>
<p>In future work, it could be investigated how many individuals can be integrated into a single functional group by musical performance. Can the results of the studies really explain the cooperative group size of human or do they only apply to small exclusive groups?</p>
<p>In addition, it is essential to investigate the correlation between endorphin release and synchronicity. For this purpose, methods must be further developed and established (e.g. PET scanning). Only in this way is it possible to say to what extent these two factors are mutually dependent. It is possible that the synchronicity triggers the endorphin release or vice versa. What ultimately led to the formation of groups and whether dancing and making-music is the decisive factor for this remains unclear.</p>
