Archaeology, the study of the human past through material culture, is often not considered to be a very useful discipline to study the evolution of cognition in humans, like music. However, I will show in which ways archaeology can make a valuable contribution to the study of the evolution of music.   

Main points and significance
---

Firstly, archaeology provides evidence for extinct species that might also have had music. Other *Homo* species have been found, which might have had similar abilities. Studying their context and their bones and retrieving aDNA from them can increase our understanding of these different species making comparative analyse possible. For example, Neanderthals also had the FOXP2 gene and a similar hyoid bone as modern humans, indicating they had a comparable larynx, making vocalisation possible (Morley, 2003; Killin, 2018). Quite recently another *Homo* species was discovered: *Homo denisova.* Only a fingerbone was found from which ancient DNA was extracted which revealed it was a different species. These three *Homo* species have interacted and interbred. Mixing of these species makes it likely they were similar and hence had similar abilities (Reich *et al.,* 2010).

Secondly, archaeology increases our understanding of the context in which humans evolved. There have been several periods in our past where humans started to demonstrate more ‘symbolic behaviour’, like in the Upper Palaeolithic. Music is often seen as a component of symbolic behaviour. If one wants to understand why such behaviour arises, one should study the context in which it emerged, which is possible with archaeology (Scarre, 2013). What is interesting is that this sudden emergence of symbolic behaviour is not constricted to a specific time-period. *Homo sapiens* appeared in North America around 20,000 years ago, but they only started to portray similar symbolic behaviour to that in Europe around 5,000 years ago. It seems unlikely that the people that populated America would be biologically different from the people in Europe, indicating there are cultural or environmental pressures responsible for the emergence of symbolic behaviour including music (Botha & Knight, 2009).

Furthermore, archaeology is the only discipline that can provide direct evidence of musical instruments of the past. The oldest instrument that has been found is a flute dating to around 40 kya and there is no evidence for the creation of instruments in any other species. Maybe in the future we will find evidence of musical instruments of further back. Although it is very likely that music existed long before this flute was produced, it is still a significant finding which makes you wonder why it was made in this time period and not tens or hundreds of thousands years before. It is also very plausible that earlier instruments were made of more perishable materials like wood, which are less likely to end up in the archaeological record (Killin, 2018).

And finally, there are also other indications which can be used as proxies for the emergence of music. One can think about the creation of stone tools. During the late Acheulean, a time-period from around 500 kya, new tools appeared including spears, hand axes and hafted tools. This was the first time tools were created using more than one material, which no other animals does. The creation of these tools requires skill specialisation, intentional teaching and an increasing sensibility to aesthetic. Especially the hand axes were becoming more symmetrical and some of them were so big that they couldn’t be used, indicating they had an aesthetic function or played a role in status.  Also, knapping makes sounds, and although this was not the main aim, it was a form of percussion as two objects are intentionally hit against each other. These aspects of tool manufacture indicate cognitive abilities which are of importance to the emergence of music. It’s also suggested that once human species started using fire, they also starting singing and dancing as you can imagine happens around a campfire, to increase social bonding (Killin, 2018).

Future work

To conclude, there are many ways in which archaeology can contribute to the study of the evolution of music. It can provide evidence for extinct species that are closely related to humans, it increases our understanding of the context in which humans evolved, it provides evidence of musical instruments of the past and creates the opportunity to use other proxies like tool use and fire as indications for the evolution of music. Therefore, archaeological research should continue and it should not be neglected in other disciplines.
