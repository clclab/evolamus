We are all familiar with the debate about whether language is an uniquely human trait or not, and many studies tried to find evidence for language in primates or other mammals. While even the findings of these studies are extremely criticized, language in invertebrates is found to be merely impossible by linguistics. However, there has been found one form of communication in honeybees, which is called the waggle dance, that shows some similarities with certain aspects of human language. The language hypothesis for this dance is still found to be highly controversial amongst linguistics, with statements like ‘Unlike language, the bee dance can be observed without any idea of the significance of the activity we are looking at’ (Smith, 2006). In my presentation, I will discuss the results of different studies on the honeybee dance that provide evidence against this statement, and show the importance of using the multicomponent view in studying language in non-human species.

The honeybee waggle dance is a well-studied phenomenon. When foraging honeybees find an attractive food source, they perform a special communicative behaviour, called the dance language, to provide information to nestmates about the location of the found resource. The bee starts with a linear ‘wiggle’ in which the bee shakes its abdomen from side to side, and then turns either to the left or right and circles back to repeat the waggle. The duration of the straight waggle phase indicates the distance to the source, and the direction relative to the beehive encodes the direction relative to the sun’s azimuth.

The first paper found evidence for a dialect in the waggle dance between two different honeybee species. This dialect encodes in the waggle duration, where Asiatic honeybees show a significant longer duration than European honeybees. However, when Asiatic bees were reared in a colony of European bees, the two species were able to communicate with each other and the Asiatic honeybees were even able to correctly find the communicated location on the first try (Su *et al., *2008). This finding would indicate that different species have evolved the same adaptation for a communication system but that there are ‘cultural differences’, and that there is learning component present in this honeybee dance language.

The second paper suggests that the waggle dance initially evolved as a communication form to convey information about new nest sites, and was later adapted for the context of foraging. This was concluded from results on the differences in the directional dance precision between two honeybee species. The species most similar to the common ancestor (*Apis florea*) showed no differences between this precision in communicating nest sites or food resources. However, a different bee species (*Apis mellifera*) increased the precision of its dance when advertising a nest site with a precise location, for instance a cavity in a tree, and the precision was decreased when communicating food sources (Beekman *et al., *2008).

The last paper found that predation risk at a potential food site has a high influence on the dance behaviour of the honeybees. Honeybees returning from foraging on dangerous flowers are less likely to perform the waggle dance and engage in fewer waggle runs than foragers returning from safe flowers (Abbot & Dukas, 2009). They also saw that experienced foragers intentionally steer naïve observers away from dangerous flowers. These last two papers clearly show that certain aspects of the bee dance can have a completely different meaning when small changes are added, indicating the significance of the activity.

The results of these studies prove that the honeybee waggle dance is a communication system with properties as symbolism, compositionality, semanticity, and social learning, that are all also known characteristics of human language. This suggests that the dance language indeed comes close to a form of language, but we still need to be careful with interpreting these results. The honeybee language can not be considered a true language, since it lacks critical aspects like recursion, phonemic coding, and syntax. However, studying the honeybee waggle dance can still give us some great insights in the evolution of language, and bees might even be used in future work as model animals for language analysis.
