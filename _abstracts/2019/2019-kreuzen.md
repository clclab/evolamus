Most scientists agree that population size can influence the evolution of language. What they do not agree upon, however, is what exactly this influence is and what it looks like. An example of such a disagreement concerns the effect of populations size on the lexical change rate of a language. It is debated whether or not this even has an influence and, if so, what this influence looks like. I argue that the effect of population size on its own does not significantly influence the lexical change rate of a language.

Evidence for this comes from studies on the effect of population size on the gain and the loss of cognates in related languages. Cognates are words from different languages that are similar because they share a common ancestor. Broman and colleagues (2015) found that in Polynesian languages, rates of word gain are higher in larger populations than in smaller populations. Rates of word loss, in contrast, are higher in smaller populations than in larger populations. These results would suggest that population size does influence the lexical change rate of a language. However, when this was repeated by Greenhill and colleagues (2018), no such effect was found. For Austronesian and Bantu languages, there was no effect of population size on the lexical change rate at all. For Indo-European languages, there was a correlation between population size and lexical change rate for word loss but not for word gain.

Furthermore, the effect of population size on the lexical change rate depends on the model that is used. Wichmann and colleagues (2008) defined a language by several features, including lexical features. They designed two models. In local models, a person could only learn from its neighbors in the network. In global models, a person could learn from any person in the network. The researchers also included different diffusion probabilities, which are the probabilities that a person adopts a feature of another language. In local models with intermediate and high diffusion probabilities, and in global models with intermediate diffusion probabilities, population size did not influence the lexical change rate. Only in global models with high diffusion probabilities did population size have an effect. In these models, the lexical change rate decreased when population size increased.

Lastly, the effect of population size on the lexical change rate depends on the learning environment. Baumann (2018) found that variability in learning environment is an important confounding factor. He looked at the stability of a lexical item. This was measured by the reproductive ratio, which was defined as the number of people that have learned a newly introduced lexical item. This, in turn, influenced the lexical change rate of a language. When the variability in the learning environment was absent or low, the stability of a lexical item increased when the population size increased. However, when variability in the learning environment got bigger, the stability of a lexical  item decreased, and this effect got stronger when the population size increased.

To summarize, the effect of population size on the lexical change rate is not universal, depends on the model that is used, and is confounded by learning environment variability. From this it can be concluded that population size on its own does not significantly influence the lexical change rate of a language. Studying this effect is important because it can reveal potential mechanisms by which language has evolved. Also, conclusions drawn from studies on this have implications for the way in which models are used to reconstruct the evolution of language.

Besides the effect of population size on the lexical change rate of a language, future work should investigate the effect of population size on other aspects of language change rate. An example is the effect of population size on the phonetic or semantic change rate of a language. The effects of population size on different aspects of language change rates could then be compared to find similarities and differences between them.
