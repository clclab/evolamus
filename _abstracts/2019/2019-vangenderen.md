In my presentation I argue based on the StS illusion and backed up by archeological and cognitive arguments that the origins of language lie in musicality.

In 1995 Diana Deutsch discovered the Speech-to-Song illusion. By repeatedly playing certain sentences, she could create the illusion of song for her subjects. No training, context or edits to audio. Participants experienced it like singing and even changed the pitch of the sentence to better fit the perceived melody. In her paper she explains that whether a sentence is spoken or heard depends on the delivery. Speech is more rapidly changing and continuous in its characteristics, while song is commonly discrete drawn out pitches. It is widely held that speech and song are processed differently by listeners because of their characteristics as described above and/or differing neurological systems. 

Deutsch already proposed that while speech and language mostly share their neural pathways, the specific circuits that determine the perception of the stimulus as speech or song are triggered by its characteristics. Pitch is relatively rarely salient in speech perceptually. 
She refers to Schneider et al. (2005) who found brain regions that were activated by high pitch salience. She wonders if the repeated listening might be enough to activate them.

The existence of the StS illusion finally allowed researchers to compare the neural processing of speech and song with nearly identical stimuli. 
Tierney at all (2013) used audiobooks that contained both StS and non StS sentences as stimuli. This is  different than Deutsch, who used the same sentences in all conditions.
They studied the differences in processing of these stimuli using fMRI. Their results show that an area linked to song and pitch salience are more activated by the StS illusion than by normal speech. They reason that speech processing places less demands on these areas. 

Hymers et al. (2015) used a newer quieter fMRI machine to study the differences in processing. They used the same stimuli for speech and song to isolate the difference in the neuronal activity of the percepts. They contradict the theory of pitch salience as the determining factor the previous two papers used. Because there are more factors than just pitch salience that influence the distinction, they argue against the proposed salience inhibition theory. Their results implicate the midposterior STS/MTG and left frontotemporal loop. Whilst these are not often linked to pitch salience, they do indicate how in what way participants interpret the StS illusion. The studies show an underlying shared neural network in which the distinction between speech and song is decided. Their shared neural networks also point towards a shared evolutionary origin. 

This is also argued in the book The Singing Neanderthals: the Origins of Music, Language, Mind and Body by Steven Mithen (2005). Here he argues that neanderthals most likely possesed at least some musicality because of the pressures on better  communication that their rapidly changing ecological niches would have placed. The cultural achievements of the neanderthals show a strong coherence that makes the presence of musicality probable. There is no archeological evidence for language-mediated behaviour in humans until millenia past the oldest homo sapiens fossils.This indicates a late development of language that was not present from the start. If musicality was present in neanderthals, it should also have been in early homo sapiens.

Another indication of the seniority of musicality comes from the innate musicality found in infants. They respond more to “motherese” and prefer their mothers song over her speech, as was found by Nahata-Trehub (2004) and Trevarthen (1999).

My theory is that musicality preceded language or at least played a vital role in its origin. Nowadays the two have seperate functions, but it could be that the illusion negates this developed boundary. Child development shows them preferring song over speech. The illusion also illustrates the shared cognitive resources. When viewed together the research shows that infants possess musicality before language, the processing of speech and song share neural networks, processing speech inhibits certain networks that are active for language. It seems that speech is a more specialised form of song. For future research it would be interesting to determine whether sign-language is also derived from song or dance. I see no way to ethically test whether an infant can learn speech without learning music and song, but that would be insightful too.
