Dancing has never been a topic of interest for scientific researchers, especially on an evolutionary approach. Dancing has been mostly hypothesized to be evolved as a by-product after music and rhythm. However, when reasoning gets deeper, it is difficult to make a distinction between dancing and creating/making certain music or rhythm. Many ancient societies have no separation between dancing and music, therefore use one word to describe this combination. No exact scientific description is present on what exactly could be named as dancing and what can be not. Concurrently, it is very challenging to create such a contrast. Initially, tap dance could be a contemporary example of interrelatedness.

Recent findings in neuroscience and comparative psychology revealed a surprising link between dance and imitation (Ravignani and Cook 2016, Laland et al. 2016). Imitation plays an essential role in learning and memorizing the dance, in many animals, including humans (Brass and Heyes 2005). From a modern perspective, both, musicians and dancers imitate a certain dynamic reality they see or hear. The creativeness plays a crucial role in the formation of distinctive forms in rhythm, music, and dance. A question comes up to me: Would it be possible to create a certain rhythm, music, or dance, without never having heard of any? Interestingly, it is observed that entertainment to a musical beat is almost only seen in animals that are capable of motor or vocal imitation (Fitch 2013, Patel 2006, Feenders et al. 2008) Not to mention, dancing is also thought to play a central role in social bonding and entertainment, in larger groups of humans (Reader and Laland 2002)

Some researchers suggest that dancing has co-evolved together with music and are not truly separable. This may increase the evolutionary significance of dance, its potential link to music, and even language. To understand its neural mechanisms and evolutionary function (if there is one), larger groups of species need to be studied further. Initially, more observational and experimental studies are necessary to confirm any hypothesis on the evolution of dance and its interrelation to music or imitation.
