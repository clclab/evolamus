For a long time, the synchronization to a musical beat was thought to be uniquely human, however, it was found that a sulphur-crested cockatoo, named Snowball, was able to synchronize to a musical beat (Cate*et al.*, 2016; Patel *et al.*, 2009a). When measuring the timing of his head bobs with regards to the musical beat, they found a value that was slightly after beat, however this value was not significantly different from zero, which means that Snowball was, so to say, perfectly bobbing on the beat (Patel *et al.*, 2009a). This took the attention of many researchers, who started to do research on this phenomenon. Besides being able to synchronize to a musical beat almost just as well as humans, Kheen *et al.* (2019) found that Snowball was also able to use a variety of dance moves, that were not executed in his regular daily behavior.

Main points

The ‘vocal learning and rhythmic synchronization’ hypothesis, predicts that, only species that use vocal learning, like humans, birds and some sea mammals are capable of synchronizing to a musical beat, and that it is probably a byproduct of the auditory and motor neural circuits in the brain that are responsible for complex vocal learning (Cate *et al.*, 2016). Besides this argument, proof for this hypothesis is also that vocal learning in birds involves modifications to brain regions like the basal ganglia, that have been shown to also be involved in human vocal learning, and that some of these modified brain regions are involved in human beat perception in music (Patel *et al.*, 2009b). More proof for this hypothesis has been provided in a research in which they surveyed YouTube videos of animals moving to music and found that all the species that were synchronous with the music were vocal learners (Schachner *et al.*, 2009). We can only count this as evidence when an actual scientific research is done on these species moving to music, since on YouTube it is not visible if the animals might be trained or are imitating a human they are seeing.

But there have also been critiques on the vocal learning and rhythmic synchronization hypothesis. It was thought that the skill of vocal learning is a prerequisite for beat perception and synchronization, however it has been proven that parrots have more in common with humans than just the vocal learning (Patel *et al.*, 2009b). These traits are complex vocal learning, open-ended vocal learning, nonvocal movement imitation, and living in complex social groups. Starlings only have open-ended vocal learning and chimps only share two of these traits with humans and therefore cannot synchronize to a musical beat, which shows that this critique on the vocal learning and synchronization hypothesis makes sense and has a good possibility to be reliable. Yet, it is not quite clear which of the four traits are in fact the ones that are needed for beat perception and synchronization in a species. Dolphins share all four of the traits with humans and parrots, so it would be nice to do research on this species as well.

Significance
---

This subject is important for the study of evolution of language and music, since it is a good example of an analogous trait and can also be redirected to the multicomponent perspective on musicality. Beat perception is one of the components of musicality and Snowball, amongst others, proves that this component is present in some parrot species. Another point why this topic is important, is that beat perception and synchronization has a big impact on the motor system in humans, since it has been shown that some patients with Parkinson’s disease were able to walk properly when synchronizing their steps to a musical beat when they were not able to do this normally.

Future work
---

In the future, comparative studies should be done between species to find out which of the four traits mentioned before are in the end responsible for beat perception and synchronization. Besides, the link between vocal learning and beat synchronization can be researched by looking at non-vocal learning species to see if they can synchronize to a beat or not. And finally, researchers could look at other components of musicality, and if they can be found in other species according to the multicomponent perspective.
