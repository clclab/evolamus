Many competing theories and research projects have been conducted over the centuries in order to conclude what exactly causes consonance (and dissonance) within humans, with consonance referred to as the perceived pleasantness of simultaneously sounding musical notes or compositions and with dissonance as its oppisite. Today, scientists and researchers are still in debate, leading to the absence an “universal accepted answer”. This brief meta-analysis provides an overview of the current findings in this field.

Main points
----

**Instantaneous consonance is driven by periodicity**  explained as the repetitive structure that characterizes human language as well in time (beats) as frequencies (pitches). Periodicity is considered to be fundamentally for human speech understanding (Oxenham, 2018), and therefore due to long-term exposure likely to be positively experienced.

**Instantaneous consonance is driven by spectral interference**  explained as the phenomenon in which two or multiple fundamental frequencies and their corresponding overtones are being located in such a position that it could therefore either be experienced as unpleasant (perceived as dissonant) or pleasant (perceived as consonant) for instance any of the major chords. (e.g. Dillon, 2013; Mashinter, 2006)

**Instantaneous consonance is driven by culture** explained as the habituation in the life-history of an individual to certain compositions, chords and musical styles due to several (cognitive) mechanisms such as the exposure effect and the classical conditioning in the co-occurance of musical features as spectral interference and external features as certain instruments or violent lyrics. I believe this cutural shift in music appreciation is experienced by almost everybody in western cultures. For instance a lot of people adapt their muscial preference throughout the years to the preferences of socially close bonded individuals. (Arthurs, Beeston, &amp; Timmers, 2018; Johnson-Laird et al., 2012; McDermott et al., 2016; McLachlan, Marco, Light, &amp; Wil- son, 2013; Omigie, Dellacherie, &amp; Samson, 2017)

General
----

Basically within this main question I came to find that all researches and scientists concerned with this problem are pretty divided between the different arguments (those three are mainly the arguments, however there are more perspectives on/about consonance).
Evolutionary significance
Following McDermott et al. (2016), the aesthetic responses to consonance and dissonance are assumed by scientists to have biological roots and therefore likely to be universally present in humans, while many ethnomusicologists at the same time believe that the phenomena are nothing more but results from western culture. The research conducted by McDermott et al. compared musicians, non-musicians and a South-American tribe called Tsimane in their perceived perception. They suggested that musical consonance indeed does not reflect innate biases. However, in 2017 Bowling, D. and his colleagues reported that McDermott their conclusion of unconstrained biology within musical consonance was widely inconsistent with the majority of available data, and is also believed to be called in question because of many methodological issues.
In the search for science to understand how music got into our lives and why it is at least present in our species, it is considered to be quite important to understand what exactly drives some people to experience pleasantness over the same compositions as what other people experience as unpleasant, and whether this driving force has been developed due to innate- or environmental components.

Significance in general
---

The explanation of its significance could be a vary of things, I personally review it as a fundamental step or either bridge between the understanding with at the one side musical experience (linked to brain activity etc) and at the other side the entire commercial world with its businessess (entertainment, videos, music till stock markets). Imagine such thing as individual software that can be downloaded against prices, that increases the experience of an entertainment piece, which can be either a song or a movie.

Future work
----

According to Harrison &amp; Pearce (2019), it would be most accurate to expand the existing empirical datasets, with particular focus on varying chord size (only researches have been done with two or three tones), voice chords and timbre. Bowling conducted a quite large research in which he investigated all previous researches in the field and added his own computational model, very interesting.
