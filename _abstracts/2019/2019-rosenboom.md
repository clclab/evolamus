AP (absolute pitch) perception is the ability to identify the pitch of a tone or the ability to produce a tone at a given pitch without the use of an external reference pitch. The ability is a very rare property in humans. AP perception in many other vertebrate animals is a common property. The difference in occurrence of AP perception across vertebrate indicates a difference in functionality. This review focused on the underlying functionality of AP perception in the Danio Rerio (Zebrafish), the Stunus Vulgaris (Starling) and Homo Sapien (human). Expanding our knowledge about the functionality of AP perception can result in a expanding of our general knowledge about evolution. Moreover knowledge about the functionality of complicated features like AP perception will give us a working frame that could help us understand the functionality of other complicated features better. 

Research (A.Rafeal et.al 2019) in Zebrafishes showed that AP perception differ between Zebrafishes population from different freshwater habitats.This may indicates that AP perception is Zebrafishes is functional to survival in noisy environments. A main complication for this study is that the difference between categorical perception and AP perception is hard to make, due to the inability of the Zebrafish to produce sound. Another bigg complication of this study are the differences between Freshwater habitats. They do not only differ in noisiness but in temperature, depth and water visibility as well. AP pitch perception could be evolved due to other environmental features than noisiness. Future investigation could focus on a better determination of AP perception in fish. Furthermore research could be done with the use of a better choosed zebrafish populations to reduce other environmental features.

The AP perception in Starling is functional for mate selection(S. MacDougall et.al 1996). AP perception in Starling ensures that the female can better determine the genetical fitness of her partner. It would be logical to see sexual differences in Starlings ability of AP perception, but sex differences in AP perception are not found yet. Future investigation could focus on sexual differences of AP perception in song-birds. 

AP perception in humans is a very difficult topic to investigate. There is no clear dividing line between AP perception and a very well trained relative pitch perception. Moreover

there is are huge differences between individuals who have the property of AP perception. Due to this great difference there is no genetically correlate found for AP perception. Ancient societies are hard to investigate as well because AP perception does not fossilize. Evolutionary relatives of the humans are not yet researched for there AP perception, but future investigation could focus on AP perception in human evolutionary relatives. A good way to investigate AP perception in human is to investigate the development of AP perception in infant humans. Research has shown that the ability to perceive AP is developed early in life (A.Takeuchi et.al 1993). It could be possible that AP perception would have been functional for some ancient human society, resulting in a approximately universal probability for developing AP perception. But a lot of research needs to be done if we want to make this conclusion. Research could be focussed on ancient human society that were heavily exposed with music. Moreover research could focus on bigger subsets of infants who were heavily exposed to music this way the early life developing would become more likely. 

Summarising it can be concluded that the Starling evolved AP perception to better classify the genetical fitness of the male birds. In human there is a early life time development theory for AP perception. And there is a weak suggestion that the Zebrafish evolved AP perception due to noisy environments.
