Background
---

Central to social communication is emotion recognition. Humans recognise emotion by verbal such as prosody and non-verbal cues such as facial expressions and body language (Cowen et al., 2019; Stock et al., 2007). Five emotions are universally identified across humanity: fear, anger, sadness, happiness and disgust. However, the belief whether or not surprise is a universal emotion varies (Ratliff & Patterson, 2008). Five of these vocalized emotions can already be identified by two-year-old children (Wu et al., 2017). Could emotion recognition be a trait that is learned though experience over time or is emotion recognition already present by birth because it is embedded in our genes? In short, is the emotion recognition an innate or learned ability?

Main points
---

Several people argue emotion recognition is an innate ability. Firstly, emotion recognition is a cross-cultural phenomenon to great extent. Earlier research shows that people can recognize 12 emotion categories from prosody across the United States and Indian cultures (Cowen et al., 2019). Furthermore, some emotional expressions are universal across the cultures of China, India, Korea, Japan and the United States (Cordaro et al., 2017). Moreover, closely related species like some primates show homologue characteristics. Emotional facial signalling in chimpanzees is partly similar to humans (Parr et al., 2017). Also emotion prosody in voice signalling is used by less related species such as mammals like humpback whales (Doyle et al., 2008). Besides, human infants recognize emotion very early on. New-borns discriminate between three different emotional expressions (Field et al., 2018). After seven months they represent even more emotional expressions and discriminate expressions within valence (Walker, 1997). Infants also show mismatch negativity when hearing emotional sounds (Kostilainen et al, 2018).

However, the ability of emotion recognition is also influenced by the environment. Maternal depression causes an impairment of emotional understanding in children (Priel et al., 2019). Furthermore, French and German babies cry differently indicating the influence of the environment (Mampe et al., 2009). Emotion recognition in infants appears to be needed for understanding whether or not an environment is safe. Parents guide their children by implementing emotions in their voice and brief facial displays (Hertenstein & Campos, 2004). Emotion recognition is a tool to understand how to establish status, trust, affection and forgiveness (1-6).

In conclusion, emotion recognition seem to be a mixture of both nature and nurture. Emotion recognition is hardwired into our genes, but is also influenced by our environment and experiences.

Significance
---

Emotion recognition is an important part of social interaction between humans. It seems to be an ability humans are born with, but is also influenced later on. There seems to be an interaction between the innate part and the learned part of emotion recognition. Emotion recognition is not only present in humans, but also in other animals that do not seem to speak a language. Filippi hypothesized that the capacity of recognizing emotions from prosody was present before prosody in language evolved and that linguistic prosody is build on that very capacity of emotion recognition (Filippi, 2016). We can hypothesize similarly at the whole of emotion recognition. It seems that the ability of emotion recognition paved the way for the evolution of language. Emotion recognition seem to be play a viral role in acquiring language.

Future work
---

Rather than investigating to what extent emotion recognition is innate and what part is learned (nature versus nurture), investigating the nature of nurture would be better. Future research can give insight about the biologic basis supporting emotional recognition. By gaining more knowledge about emotion recognition, what seems to have paved the way for language, we can get closer to understanding of the evolution of language itself.
