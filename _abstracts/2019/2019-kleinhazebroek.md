There has been a debate about universality and origin of colour terms for decades. Some argue that the way colours are categorized is universal, whereas other think language plays a role in colour naming. Berlin and Kay are known for fieldwork across 110 unindustrialized, unwritten languages, and this data from the 1960’s is collected in the so-called World Colour Survey (WCS). They concluded that there are eleven universal focal colours, but their categorical boundaries are shaped by language. Berlin and Kay also created an evolutionary framework that implies that all languages gradually go through seven stages of colour naming.

Although it seemed like a solid framework at the time, not everyone agrees with the way data in the WCS is collected and interpreted. A more recent paper by Conway and colleagues discusses three issues regarding Berlin and Kay’s approach: 1) the Munsell colour space that is used in the WCS is irregular, categorical boundaries are therefore pre-determined, 2) task instructions were complex and restrictive, and 3) there is evidence from early-stage languages that do have the complete colour-categorization knowledge. A new approach from information theory is presented; this system defines how efficiently a term communicates different colour percepts. Based on communication efficiency in the WCS, three stages (instead of seven) of colour categorization are suggested. The first includes red and orange (thought to represent behaviour), the second adds yellow and brown (thought to represent environment) and the third adds purple (thought to develop with industrial technologies). Blue and green remain communicated very poorly, even in fully developed languages.

Majid and colleagues investigated the influence of language on coding of other senses as well (colour, shape, sound, touch, taste and smell). The study suggests that all languages have different codability systems for different senses, maybe depending on population size (indicates industrialization/political centralization), education level or cultural practices. Codability of colour is, in almost all languages, higher than codability of shape, sound, touch and smell, and thus seems to be communicated quite efficiently. How is this possible?

Both the Berlin-Kay and Conway’s framework seem to align with the theory of linguistic relativity, or, the so called Whorf hypothesis. This hypothesis states that native language influences thought. Regier and Kay reviewed whether this is true, and it appears to be true to a certain extent only. Verbalization and access to the mental lexicon are thought to activate regions in the left hemisphere of the brain mostly, but vision is contralateral. Colour categorization and other categorical perception tasks have a verbal, linguistic basis, which happens to be in the left hemisphere. Gilbert and colleagues have confirmed that in colour perception, indeed only the right visual field is affected by language; remember that brain processing is inferred in the visual field. They believe that the categories exist prelinguistically, but are recalled faster with linguistic labels attached to them.

Research on colour categorization thus tells us that there is a universal basis for colour perception, that language evolves according to communication efficiency, that vision is coded more conveniently than other senses and that colour perception is only influenced by half the visual field. There seem to be multiple influences that shaped how colour evolves in different languages, and we should be careful when saying that language is the definite tool that is responsible for colour perception. Language is just the perceivable object, but there are probably more cultural and neurological underlying influences than previously thought.
