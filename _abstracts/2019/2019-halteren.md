In order for speech to be conducted, the physical presence of the right organs is needed and just as important the voluntary self-control of these organs to manipulate them to produce the right sounds (Lameira &amp; Shumaker, 2019). Humans are able to product a wide variety of sounds, from low to high pitch, and this seems essential in our use of language.

Humans are not the only great apes that can improvise when producing sounds with their mouth. When looked at orangutans they show multiple abilities, despite the differences in the vocal tract and communication culture. First, orangutans are able to make species atypical vocalisations with a kazoo. Lameira &amp; Schumaker conducted an experiment in 2019 to find evidence that orangutans can reach active voicing in which orangutans were given a membranophone. By making sounds, not blowing, into a membranophone the oscillating air pressure makes the membrane vibrate which produces a variety of sounds. Results showed that untrained orangutans were able to make species-atypical individual-specific sounds and that after some experience they altered their voice to play the membranophone. These results confirmed active voicing in orangutans.

Another experiment conducted by Lameira et al. (2013) showed orangutans were also able to produce a voiceless call; whistle. Whistling orangutans were observed and whistling recordings were analysed. With one orangutan they also conducted an experiment, they had a human whistle a rhythm and it was the task for the orangutan to repeat this same whistling rhythm. Results showed ten whistling orangutans and that the tested orangutan was able to match the human whistle with significantly high levels of performance.

To investigate speech-like rhythm in a voiced and voiceless orangutan call, Lameira et al. (2015) did a cinematic analyses. Tree hypothesis were tested; 1. Great apes produce 5Hz-rhythm signals, 2. Speech like rhythm involves sounds similar to consonants and vowels &amp; 3. Speech-like rhythm is experience-based. The cinematic analysis showed that an orangutan was able to produce two speech-like rhythms, using vocal fold and supralaryngeal action, or independent manoeuvring over lips and tongue. The rhythms were several times higher than chewing rates, indicating homologies between great ape calls and human consonants and vowels and therefore the ability to speech.

When looked at wild orangutans, Hardus, Lameira, Schaikd and Wich (2009) also found evidence of speech abilities in wild orangutans. Wild orangutans were seen using tools to make a kiss sound. By holding leaves in their mouth they were able to decrease the frequency of the sound. Keeping in mind that orangutans only made this sound when in distress, they made two predictions why orangutans would do this; 1.  The frequency of the kiss sound is related to body size &amp; 2. With most acute danger orangutans will use leave tools. But most importantly, they found indications that these kiss sounds were under volitional control.
All conducted researches support the theory that orangutans can make funny sounds needed for language, and can therefore be considered ‘speech ready’. These results show that multiple abilities needed for language are not exclusively shown by humans. Therefore it contributes to the discussion of the evolution of language within humans. In further research it is needed to conduct different language experiments with orangutans, such as if they understand grammar or if they have the needed memory.
