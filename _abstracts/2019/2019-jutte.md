Language is a uniquely human trait. The ability to develop language relies on capabilities, such as fine control of the mouth and the larynx, these are absent in chimpanzees and other great apes. By finding a mutation in the FOXP2 gene in a family (KE family) who have articulation difficulties and linguistic and grammatical impairment (Enard et al., 2002), they found out that FOXP2 is the first gene that is relevant to the human ability to develop language. Besides that, Enard et al. (2002) also found out that the FOXP2 protein is highly conserved, because the small differences between different species. They also find out that these two amino-acid variants are fixed among humans, because they do not find any polymorphism in these amino-acids. They concluded that this gene possibly has caused language.

Main points
-----------

The first main point is that there is no support for positive selection at the FOXP2 gene, and from this you can concludethat this gene has not led to language on its own. Krause et al. (2007) found out that our closest extinct relatives, the Neandertals, also have the two evolutionary changes in FOXP2, what was thought to be the reason that we have language. Another study by Atkinson et al. (2018), find polymorphic parts in the two amino-acid variants in African human populations, which also implicate that this gene not led to language.

The second main point says something about the evolution of language and what FOXP2 has to do with this. The first main point supports the gradualist approach towards language, with the thought that many genes have small effects. The initial report on the FOXP2 mutation as human specific was used as an argument for saltationist views of language evolution because they look to it more with a single-mutation view, but the results from Krause et al. (2007) and Atkinson et al. (2018), refute this and are in favour of gradualists like Pinker.

Another way to look at it is with a domain-specific view or with a domain-general view. The new research findings do not support the domain-specificity view on language. They found out that FOXP2 is widely expressed in many regions of the brain (Lai, Gerrelli, Monaco, Fisher, &amp; Copp, 2003). So, FOXP2 is not specific to the language domain. Karmiloff-Smith (2013) came with a new term, the domain-relevant approach. This approach takes the immaturity of the neonate brain into account but say that the brain starts with a limited number of basic levels each of which are somewhat more relevant to the processing of certain kinds of input over others. The findings, that say that FOXP2 is not specific to the language domain, support this domain-relevant approach (Karmiloff-Smith, 2013), and not the view that says that one gene influence just one domain. They also find out that in birds, the FOXP2 gene is more active during the learning period, when they learn singing, than during just producing the song (Haesler et al., 2004; Bolhuis, Zijlstra, den Boer-Visser, &amp; van der Zee, 2000), so this also suggest that the FOXP2 gene plays a role in learning and plasticity. FOXP2 in humans is not gene specific to language, but it is extremely relevant towards language because speech is a domain were rapid movement and planning of these movements is most critical in the human case (Fisher &amp; Scharff, 2009). The KE family also had problems with things like fine motor control (Vargha-Khadem, Watkins, Alcock, Fletcher, &amp; Passingham, 1995). So, the effects of the mutation were more widespread, this shows that the domain-specific view is not a good way to look at it, since this gene influence more domains. We have to look at it in a way more like the domain-relevant approach.</

Significance
------------

FOXP2 has not led to language on its own, and this finding influenced the genetic considerations about language. We should not expect our origins to be explained in terms of just a single gene. FOXP2 is just one piece of an elaborate puzzle. FOXP2 is an argument for the gradualist view and the domain relevant approach towards language.

Future work
----

Future work could look at if there are other “language genes” or other factors besides FOXP2 that are undiscovered or little understood, to find more and more puzzle pieces and create a more complete picture of how language is evolved.
