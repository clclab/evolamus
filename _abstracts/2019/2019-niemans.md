Grey seals are a pinniped species that are distributed over the North Atlantic Ocean and separated into three populations (eastern Atlantic, western Atlantic, Baltic sea). Their last common ancestor with humans was 65 million years ago (MYA) and the Phocidae (seals) split from the pinniped family approximately 35 MYA (Ravignani, et al., 2016). Grey seals gather in great colonies for breeding, moulting, and hauling out. (Seal conservation society, sd). They are an interesting source for research since they have a great vocal flexibility and share a more recent common ancestor to humans than birds. (Stansbury & Janik, 2019).


Main point
----

Grey Seals can alter the formants in their moan calls to frequencies they normally not use in the wild and even produce recognizable vowels. This shows that the alteration of speech to communicate (by for example adjusting formants) is not unique to humans, and even possibly shared amongst more mammal species.

Seals and dolphins have been found to use vocal learning. Together with humans, elephants, bats, whales and many bird species these are few that are actually capable of vocal production learning (Ravignani, et al., 2016).

Seals have a similar vocal tract to humans
----

Harbor seals have a very similar vocal tract to humans. The angle of vocal folds that relate to tracheal air stream is 76 degrees, where in humans this is 90 degrees. In humans, the upper vocal tract is used to produce recognizable vowels and consonants through formant filtering. Possibly, these vowels and consonants that seals can make are also produced by the upper vocal tract. The evolutionary history of the brain, environmental conditions, vocal anatomy and socio-ecology of pinnipeds is quite similar to humans (Ravignani, et al., 2016).
The phylogeny of this trait is not certain, since sea lions do not have a vocal learning capability where walruses and seals do. (Ravignani, et al., 2016).

Altering formants
----

A lot of evidence on fundamental frequency adjustment is found in other animals. However, adjustments of peak frequencies and formants which produce vowel sounds is not often discovered. Possibly, the similarity of the seal supra-laryngeal tract to humans makes this possible (Stansbury & Janik, 2019).
In a research of the university of St Andrews (Stansbury & Janik, 2019), it is found that grey seals can alter their formant frequencies. The seals showed they were able to change fundamental and peak frequencies in their calls. Also, they could produce recognizable vowel sounds by altering formants in their calls. The seals also showed enhanced auditory memory for call sequences.

The evolutionary function of Vocal learning flexibility
----

Using crowded breeding areas, signature recognition in grey seals is very important. This may be, why the ability to (re)produce different formants is evolutionary beneficial. Research showed how a group of seals on Sable Island can discriminate in calls. The mothers significantly made more head turns toward a speaker when the call of their own pup was presented rather than unfamiliar or other familiar calls. This same research explains how this is different for different colonies, possibly because they breed in different circumstances (Mcculloch & Boness, 2000).
Vocal learning can increase call diversity, which is shown in song birds to be an indication of fitness. This trait can thus relate to fitness in seals. However, it is not yet clear if this trait is simply a by-product of other adaptations, or if it purposely evolved.
In male Southern Elephant Seals, it is found that younger males imitate older successful breeders more often than other males. This can be a sign that vocal production learning can be a sexually selected for trait (Sanvito, Galimberti, & Miller, 2007). 

Percussion
----

Percussion might have been the start of musicality in the hominid lineage, empirical evidence from various fields suggest. Harbor seals drum on the water while vocalizing. This may be a signal of sexual displays, intrasexual competition, territory guarding, or a way of forming a hierarchy. This is another communality humans share with seals (Ravignani, et al., 2016).

Significance
---

The ability to modify formants in the calls of grey seals outside of their usual boundaries may explain more about the function, development and existence human speech development.

Future work
---

It would be interesting to study how an ability to (re)produce such specific sounds can be evolutionary beneficial to grey seals. To what extent are these mammals able to reproduce vowel sounds and does this only occur in juvenile grey seals, or also in adults?


Sea lions have a last common ancestor with seals approximately 35 MYA. Almost all pinnipeds are vocally flexible, except for sea lions. This is very strange, since in their evolution they experienced a neocortex increase just like humans. Their brain folding is different from other pinniped species. Interesting to look at is how different brain anatomy relates to VPL and what evolutionary pressures selected for VPL (Ravignani, et al., 2016).
