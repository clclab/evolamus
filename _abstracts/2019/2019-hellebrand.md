Melodies are an important component in music. They are successive sequences of different tones in a certain rhythm which is perceived as a single entity even if the pitch gets altered. Hereby, melodies consist of different features, exempli gratia runs, intervals, jumps, single notes (and much more). Hereby, every feature can vary and get altered which leads to an enormous possible variety. Melodies itself have an important role for humans but as well in many nonhuman species. Obviously, this is especially the case in birds. But even in monkeys the significance of melodies was investigated due to studies by Wright and colleagues (2000) where rhesus monkeys showed the ability of encoding tonal melodies relative to their key or in other words, they recognized that a melody is the same even in different octaves. This shows that melodies and thus music in general might have a close relation to the human evolution and hence, to the human nature. But in our case, it is more complicated because humans not just experienced a biological but as well cultural evolution processes. The musical taste and the possibilities of performing musicality changed a lot and so did melodies. So, the questions I wanted to address in this prospect are: (1) Why do we see the phenomenon that melodies change over time – is there a process similar to the evolution behind that? And if so, (2) Why do we have such a diversity in melodies nowadays since an evolutionary process should decrease variations of a specific trait (here: melody) in order to bring up the most suiting adaptation to the selection pressure?

A study by Shanahan and Albrecht (2019) showed that one can indeed find an evolution-like process behind evolving melodies. Specific variations of features of a melody – which could be seen as an equivalent of an adaptive trait – can be selected by an individual of a society and then, due to the social learning ability of humans be transmitted in a “transmission chain” to another member of this society and so on. The driving force behind those decisions about what to select or what to vary might be the taste of the individual which in turn is dependent on its culture and social status (Klusen et al., 1978). Another idea is that one selects features of a vocal melody that are physically easier to produce.

Nevertheless, as mentioned before, due to a specific alteration and selection the variety of melodies should decrease over the time. This is supported by a computational study by Loughran and O’Neil (2016) where an algorithm selected certain melody variations by chance with the result of a diversity loss. So, to come back to question (2) about why we have such a diversity in music nowadays, inspired by [a TEDx talk from 2012 by the composer Michael Tilson Thomas](https://www.ted.com/talks/michael_tilson_thomas_music_and_emotion_through_time) I hypothesize that the cause of this is simply technology. The invention of musical notation (sheet music) enabled melodies to resist the change over time. Furthermore, music production programs for computers et cetera enabled individuals to compose extremely complex music / melodies or vary (“remix”) already present ones which both is highly independent on their physical abilities. The last point is that with invention of new media (vinyl, CDs, Internet) the way of transmission is not just a single chain anymore but rather a huge complex network which acts global and thus throughout cultures which makes the view of the previous mentioned selection pressure far more complicated.

To conclude, melodies can indeed evolve in an evolution-like process but nowadays melodies are more stable due to technical inventions for composing and distributing music. The present global transmission of music is cultural independent so there is no single society dependent selection pressure acting alone on the selection of melody variations.
Thus one can see that the situation is getting quite complex in nowadays circumstances and to gain further insights in the evolving melodies process and its relevance for humans, further studies are needed.
