The aim of the research was to find evidence for the existence of beat perception in infants. When looking for the innateness and developmental pathway of beat perception in infants, it could be stated that this trait was used for musical learning and social bonding later in life. When investigating this development of the beat perception, it could maybe be explained why this beat perception and synchronization is human-specific.

When listening to music, we will respond to the beat by tapping our foot, head bang or clapping. In order to do so, we need our auditory and motor systems which are used for the perception, recognition and production of the beat. Therefore, it is suggested that there is a auditory-motor interaction that underlies the communication between the two systems. When listening to music, we must extract the relevant beat information from this complex auditory input. To do so, the auditory brain areas are necessary. Next, we the beat extraction is made, we need to make predictions about the beat in order to plan our precisely timed motor response output. For this prediction making and motor output generating, we need our motor cortex, premotor cortex, basal ganglia and our SMA. Beat perception is an increase in connectivity between brain areas. (Granh & Brett, 2007) (Zatorre et al., 2007).

Bidirectional activation of audio-motor system

We now know that there is a great interaction between the auditory and motor systems in the human brain, when precepting a beat. When discussing the movements that human makes when precepting a beat, it could be that the vestibular system is also involved. Phillips-Silver & Trainor, 2008 considered the hypothesis that the auditory system was also influenced by the information of the vestibular system in a way that the movements of the body would affect the auditory encoding of the rhythm. They tested this hypothesis by activating the vestibular system, which lead to a feeling of headbanging. It turned out that these participants indeed had a different perception of the beat when their head moved in a different pattern. In this way it was stated that we indeed ‘feel the beat’. When looking at this in an infant developmental perspective this vestibular-auditory beat perception can argue the fact that beat perception is innated. The vestibular system develops in the prenatal in the third weeks after conception. From this moment on, the fetus is able to detect all the movements of the mother. The beat of the mother her heartbeat, breaths and walking pattern can be observed by the infant due to this vestibular-auditory beat perception. This innated feeling of the beat could be a first component of the music experience, which we all share (Trainor et al., 2009).

Neonatal MMN, beat recognition
---

Next to the beat perception of prenatal infants, there is also evidence for the beat perception in neonates. Winkler et al. (2009) discussed the fact that even though these neonates are not able to respond to the beat with motor output, like in adults, they do have beat perception. It turned out that these neonates could extracted the beat when listening to music while they were sleeping. By the use of EEG, researchers were able to identify an electrical brain response, the mismatch negativity. This MMN occurs when there is a violation in the repeating auditory input. The signal is generated when the perceived auditory input does not met the predictions that were made about the beat. So even though the babies were not able to show motor responses to the beat, they were able to show neural responses to the beat and the violation of the beat.

Another evidence for the importance of the moving when precepting beat, is the research of Phillips-Silver & Trainer (2005). This research showed that infants were who were bounced at a two or three accented beats would show preference for this two or three auditory rhythm pattern. This stated that the auditory-motor integration, and perhaps even the vestibular system, would effect the perception and so the preference of the musical rhythm the infants perceived. This research showed evidence for the fact that the auditory-motor interaction is bidirectional linked.

When infants grow older, the motor system will improve. The last stage is that the auditory stimulus would affect the body movement in order to respond to the beat. Zetner et al. (2010) concluded that infants with age between 5-12 months show significantly more rhythmic movements to music compared to speech. This indicates that there is a predisposition for rhythmic movements for music with beat in it.

When reached the complete developed auditory-motor interaction due to increased connectivity between brain areas, the responses to music can fully be used. This expresses in synchronized dancing and singing with other humans, which can increase the social bonding of the individuals. The first synchronization behavior that infants will produce is during their first months after birth. It starts out with a synchronic-like moving of mother-infants when playing. This will later in life, after a couple of months, turn into synchronic babbling. These are the first physical, emotion and social bonding signs, which will keep developing during the whole life time (Feldman et al. (2007). This first attempt of social contact will lead to musical social-bonding which is still used in our modern society.
