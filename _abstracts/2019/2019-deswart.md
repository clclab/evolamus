Without music, there is no dance (Laland, Wilkins, & Clayton, 2016). Beat detection is based on two neural mechanisms: beat induction and beat maintenance (Toivianen et al., 2019). Beat induction is based on ‘finding’ and hearing the beat in a piece of music, while beat maintenance is crucial to sustaining an inner beat. Dancing, meanwhile, requires the combining of auditory and visual inputs to create motor outputs (Laland et al., 2016).

In this presentation, I theorize that music and dance co-evolved, because for both music and dance, beat maintenance is crucial. Individuals who fail to detect a beat because of congenital amusia also fail to detect asynchronous dancing (Philips-Silver et al., 2011). This means that beat detection is a crucial component to the ability to synchronous dancing.

The neural circuit underlying beat production is complex and not much is known of it. Functional connectivity studies in rhythm perception have provided new insights by identifying associated auditory- and motor-related networks, which may facilitate the temporal predictions involved in rhythm perception (Toivianen et al., 2019). If similar neural networks are used in dance, we may be able to hypothesize that the human abilities to dance and make music also co-evolved.

While we know little of the neural networks involved in dance, we do know something about the ability to dance. Hannon, Schachner, & Nave-Blodgett (2017) showed that babies of three months do not yet detect a difference between asynchronous and synchronous dance, while 12-month-olds do. This showed that dance is not an innate, but a learned ability. Children pick up this ability very rapidly and unconsciously, however, so a basis to learn might be present in the brain.

While synchronous dancing in non-human animals, particularly songbirds, does occur, the ability is rare and seems to only apply to individuals of a species and not a species as a whole. It is hypothesized by Patel et al. (2009) that this ability is unlocked by the neural networks underlying melodic song. This means that only singing animals could learn to dance. This further strengthens the hypothesis that dance and music production co-evolved. While singing does not necessarily require beat detection, it is an important aspect of musical ability. Patel et al. (2009) also mention that the rhythmic synchronization of songbirds is similar to that of young children: it is largely in time with the music, but is not completely constant. This again confirms that beat detection is a learned process in both humans and songbirds and makes us suspect that the ability to sing may not be the only neural patterning required for dance.

A cultural reason is for the co-evolution of music and dance based on beat detection is that both strengthen similar social networks (Laland et al., 2016). Music and dance may have been of evolutionary use in group cohesion. Both strengthen social bonds with peers and make groups discernible from one another. While music and dance can be considered two separate entities, rhythm and dance are crucially intertwined. Therefore, if we can deduct more of the evolution of dance, we can also learn how music has evolved. Dance might even have been crucial to music, because dance strengthens social bonds more than music alone can do.

It is clear that much is still unknown about the co-evolution of beat detection of dance. Possible future work could explore the neural networks underlying music and dance. What parts of the brain are needed in both beat production and dance, for example? Does dancing training influence musical abilities, or vice versa? These studies could all offer more insights into the evolution of dance, music, beat detection, and their co-evolution.
