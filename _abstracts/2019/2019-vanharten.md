Deaf people can still perceive music and develop musicality. Musicality is a capacity for music, a spontaneously developing set of traits based on and constrained by our cognitive and biological system. They can use the vibrations of music to synchronize the movements with the beat of the music, which is important for example for dancing, but they can do it a lot more precisely than people who can hear.

Because the auditory modality of deaf people is often no longer fully intact, but they can still develop musicality, musicality is not only tied to the auditory modality.

The general principle behind the music, is that sound waves can generate vibrations in nearby objects. In humans, the mechanoreceptors from the somatosensory system are generally responsible for processing vibrations, and these are also capable of absorbing vibrations from music in both deaf and hearing people (Shibata et al., 2001). However, this is stronger for deaf people than for hearing people. This can be supported by a study by Russo et al (2012) which shows that the vibrotactile system can cause discrimination between different types of timbre, also using the mechanoreceptors. Another important argument is that the auditory cortex starts to process tactile information in deaf people (Levänen et al., 2001). This is a consequence of the plastic power of the brain which means that the brain of a deaf person rewires itself to process vibrations in the absence of sounds. This results in a functional compensation after an earlier sensory loss which ensures that the remaining sensory modalities can develop capacities that can exceed the normal functional system. So, a cortical reorganization of the auditory cortex is taking place for patients with total hearing loss (Lambertz et al., 2005). But according to this, the auditory module is still used, only it has a different function than it originally has in hearing people. A final argument can be either an argument for or against the claim. In hearing people, the eardrums ensure that vibrations from the air can be converted into vibrations in liquids, whereby they are also amplified. Research by Park et al. (2007) showed that these eardrums can still be intact in some forms of deafness. However, no research has yet been carried out into whether these people can still experience vibrations via these eardrums. However, these deaf people have developed musicality and can experience vibrations through the skin, so this can be both an argument for and against the claim because this has not yet been properly investigated. So according to these researches, it could be possible that the auditory module is not the module which is responsible for developing musicality, but it is still used for processing tactile information, which is also obtained from music.

Research on this subject is important because it can tell more about the evolution of musicality because it can clarify several ways of developing musicality. It may also show that musicality is indeed not tied to the auditory module, but that it may also have been developed from another basic principle. Also, it can provide more insight into the plasticity of the brain. It can also help deaf people to be more involved in daily life, for example by being able to experience music, so that they can have more fun.

For possible follow-up research it would be interesting to focus more on whether deaf people of whom the eardrum is still intact can experience vibrations using the eardrum. It is also interesting to do this for people who have been deaf since birth, where the auditory module may already process a different kind of information, and for people who have just become deaf, where the auditory module still has its original function. Besides, more research into other possible basic modules of musicality is interesting, because until now it was often assumed that this was the auditory module, while this does not have to be the case.
