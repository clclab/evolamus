Language, no matter the complexity of the system, is merely a tool for communication. It is used to transfer information from the sender to the listener. And although every language system has rules that users of that language must follow, this system also adjusts to the needs of the language users. It would therefore be likely to see some form of a connection between a language and the societal characteristics of the environment this language is spoken or evolved in (Lupyan & Dale, 2010). From all features that languages have, I thought that lexicon would be the most likely aspect to reflect societal trends, culture or structure, since lexical items are highly influenced by context (Trask & McColl Millar, 2015). This is why this has been the focus in this study. By comparing social structure to the vocabulary and lexicon of a language, I tried to find a connection between lexical characteristics and social characteristics and see what information this could provide on the evolution of languages in general.

In Mexico, a study was done with a Mayan community of weavers. The language they speak has an enormous amount of colour terms, that are all composed of several blocks that define different aspects of the colour. Moreover, it seems that new colour terms emerge with reference to newly introduced threads in the community. In a snowball study design, the weavers introduced each other to the new colours and incorporate them in their vocabulary (MacKeigan & Muth, 2006). The conclusion that this study drew from this was that this sophisticated indexical system of defining colours in extreme detail, is needed to describe the differences in threads that the Tzotzil Mayan weavers use for their weaving, and that this is why the language evolved in that way.

Another study proposed that the verb ‘have’ might have an association with cultural development. A study on this topic divided several societies into ‘property-based’ and ‘non-property-based’, by using the criterion of differential access to the means of production in that society. The languages that were spoken in these societies were analysed, and the results showed that non-property-based societies tended not to develop a transitive possessive structure in their language (Webb, 1977). This might be due to the fact that their society doesn’t revolve around possession that much.

Then, in the reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European, there are several examples of how family terms on the male side of the family are much more specific than on the female side. In this language, there are different words for different family relations on the male side of the family, whereas on the female side of the family, family would be addressed as ‘a male relative on the maternal side’. This difference in focus and distinction between paternal and maternal family is an argument that historical linguists propose for the idea that this was a patrilinear society (Mallory & Adams, 2006).

By combining the results of the studies that were described above, I have reached the conclusion that there is indeed some sort of a connection between the structure of a society and the structure of a language that is spoken within this society. In several societal aspects, namely *shared activities, economy* and *family terms*, this effect is visible. These findings can be of great importance to evolutionary studies and theories on language. It suggests that when concepts are deemed important to a society, in most cases language will eventually create words for them. Therefore, the emergence of new words in a language can provide information on societal trends, but also on horizontal transmission between cultures and the reconstruction of languages and language lineages. Moreover, this literature review shows the incredible flexibility and diversity of language and proves once more that it is subject to change and highly adaptive. Independently from the discussion whether language is innate or not and to what extent, there are many factors that affect its evolution and the influence of social structure is one that absolutely should be taken seriously.
