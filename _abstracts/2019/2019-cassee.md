Beat induction is a congenital, spontaneous and universal ability. The natural phenomenon in humans can be divided into two general abilities, namely synchronization to- and perception of the beat. These two make it possible for us to percept a regular pulse out of a musical stimulus and to synchronize our movements to this pulse. However, some individuals show to have impaired beat induction. This is expressed as reduced functioning in beat perception and/or poor motor synchronization to a beat (Sowiński & Dalla Bella, 2013; Phillips-Silver et al., 2011). This impairment is called beat deafness which is a form of congenital amusia. Congenital amusia is a more general term for musical disabilities found in humans. It is thought that congenital amusia affects +/- 3% of the population and that it is highly heritable (Mathias, Lidji, Honing, Palmer, & Peretz, 2016; Peretz & Vuvan, 2017). However, the studies responsible for these findings looked into the other form of congenital amusia (tone deafness, pitch related). Since this presentation focusses on beat deafness, these statements regarding heritability and prevalence are more assumptions than facts.

Prior researches have hypothesized and partly found that the disorder is caused by anomalies in the auditory-frontal and auditory-motor brain network and that these deficiencies cause the disability beat-deafness (Mandell, Schulze, & Schlaug, 2007; Hyde, Zatorre, & Peretz, 2010). However, with the current research results combined it can be hypothesized that the disabilities in beat deafness, which are perception and synchronization, are caused independent of each other. An extend of this hypothesis is that impaired beat perception could be caused by an anomaly in auditory-frontal connections whereas poor motor synchronization to a beat may be caused by anomalies in auditory-motor connections. This hypothesis could be of big importance for the evolutionary knowledge of music, since this would support the idea that synchronization (dance) and perception have developed as independent abilities and that therefore these two could be seen as different domains regarding musical skills.


Main points
---

In beat deafness, impaired beat perception may be caused by a malfunctioning auditory-frontal connection whereas impaired synchronization of movement to the beat may be the result of a deficit in auditory-motor connections.

First of all, beat-deaf patients do percept beat, since they show normal mismatch negativity (ERP) and P3a responses, which suggests that there is at least beat processing on a lower level in the brain (Mathias et al., 2018). Furthermore, beat deaf patients show reduced/deviating synchronization of body movements to a beat, determined with bouncing or finger tapping (Sowiński & Dalla Bella, 2013; Phillips-Silver et al., 2011). Also, patients show impaired beat perception in anisochronous detection tasks (Sowiński & Dalla Bella, 2013; Phillips-Silver et al., 2011).

Most interestingly, recent studies showed that in some beat-deaf patients only one of the two abilities was impaired (perception or synchronization) instead of both. A poor result in the synchronization task is not necessarily associated with a poor result in the perception task, and the other way around (Sowiński & Dalla Bella, 2013; Bégel et al., 2017).  

Significance
---

These findings suggest that perception (auditory-frontal) of- and synchronization (auditory-motor) to music are processed independently of each other. This assumptions result from the observations that the disabilities can be present apart from each other and thus do not necessarily affect each other.
From evolutionary perspective, this supports the idea that perception and synchronization to a beat are two different domains. This could be explained by the suggestion that both abilities had different purposes and evolutionary benefits and thus were used differently and separated. An example of such a difference is dancing (synchronization) and creating/recognizing music or the beat in music.

Future work
---

For future research it would be useful and interesting to focus on the two  different brain pathways in beat-deaf patients that are mentioned above. It would be important to determine whether the auditory-frontal connection in patients that show normal perception differs from patients that show both impairments. Logically, this should also be compared between patients that show normal synchronization and patients that show both impairments for the auditory-motor connection.
