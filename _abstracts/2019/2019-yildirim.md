The topic of sex differences in speech and vocalisations has been a long debated topic with contrasting findings. It has been studied across various species and on all premises of Tinbergen’s four questions. However, due to the politically charged controversies surrounding it – and the push-pull forces of nature vs. nurture – it has created opposing views, and as such, biases. The controversies surrounding sex differences in speech mostly object argumentations such as those which state that women speak more. This notion is being continously challenged by recent research, which has revealed that context is crucial in determining which sex has more verbal input (Onnela, Waber, Pentland, et al, 2015). As such, older studies are being constantly refurbished with newer research that add nuance and perspective. The main point I will be focusing on evidentiating in this research project are the prevalent sex differences between men and women in terms of their speech production. 

Main Point
---

This research will be focusing on the proximate, causal explanations with regards to sex differences in speech production and how universal they are across cultures. The tenets of speech production I will be focusing on are those of fundamental frequency and employed vocal space. 

My argumentation for the evident differences in the fundamental frequencies of men and women will be on the preface of differences in hormones. I will discuss the effect of testosterone on the male vocal tract – and as such, how this creates a difference between men’s vocal tracts and women’s vocal tracts. Additionally, I will focus on shifts in the fundamental frequency (in Hertz) across several stages of men’s and women’s lives; specifically, how they diverge post-puberty, and converge as they age due to the ageing vocal cords (Cartei, 2014). This will be explained through a table amalgamating studies conducted on the fundamental frequency of men and women from the 1990s onwards.

My second argument for the difference in speech production in men and women will postulate that men and women differ in the amount of vowel space employed. A study conducted on British men and women reported that women employ more vowel space than men and the vowel space they use is shifted top right compared to men’s vowel space usage (Cartei & Cowles, 2012). The methodology in this study involved asking both the female and male samples to sound as feminine as possible, and as masculine as possible. These imitations were then recorded. Additionally, the samples’ normal voices were recorded. Using these recordings, the researchers mapped out the vowel space employed across all voices. I will further strengthen my argument about women’s vowel space usage by discussing another study conducted on sex difference in vowel space employment using a study conducted on Swedish speaking men and women, and German speaking men and women. Across both languages, more vowel spaces was employed by the female samples (Weirich et al., 2019) . This shows that women’s increased vowel space spans across languages; however, the sex difference in vowel space usage is language-dependent. Moreover, I will postulate that one’s perception of gender can be derived from their vowel space employment. In a complex study, eight year old boys’ and girls’ voices were recorded and through the use of a special programme, these recordings’ fundamental frequency was extracted and equalized. Thus, the only distinguishing factor between these voices was the use of vowel space. These recordings were played back to adults, who were asked to rate the perceived femininity of the voices. It was revealed that voices that used more vowel space were perceived to be more feminine or be spoken by females (Cartei et al., 2013).

Significance of Research
---

These tenets of research are noteworthy to help expand on certain evolutionary theory about the mother-infant bond – and how a wide range of vocalizations may be useful for the offspring’s survival. These differences could also contribute to hypotheses surrounding speech and social grooming and the benefits these would pertain in evolutionary terms.

Future Studies
---

To enrich this field of research, future studies could focus on the importance of vowel space for gender perception in transgender women. A limited amount of studies – whose samples were inadequate and not uniform – were conducted on this facet of speech. This would be useful in forming concrete results on the importance – or lack, thereof – in vowel space for gender perception.

Additionally, it would be of interest to look into comparisons between mother-infant, and father-infant vocalizations, and how these contrast the range of vocalizations that men and women use with adults. This would add nuance to existing hypotheses explaining sexual dimorphisms in vocalizations and perhaps strengthen or weaken evolutionary theories pertaining to these differences.
